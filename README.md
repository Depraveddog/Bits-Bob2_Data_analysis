In this assignment 2, we were assigned with the task of identifying anomalies, creating a data mart, and loading the data into powerbi to analyse and propose strategic decisions same as assignment 1. 
We have identified those anomalies by SQL queries and excel filtering tools.
This time we have identified empty fields and duplicated receipt IDs. My group have decided to make assumptions on the empty field and to include the anomaly row inside as we want our data to be as accurate as possible and this can be clarified later on.
We perform ETL on the data through SSIS (Transformative script and conditional split)
After the data is cleaned, we designed a star schema data mart to cater to bits&bob staffs as they are not tech-savvy people.
Once the data mart is implemented in SSMS, we loaded the mart into powerBi for analysis.
